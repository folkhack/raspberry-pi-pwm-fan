# PWM Raspberry Pi Fan Controller

**ðŸ›‘ DEPRECATED! - This utility is deprecated and has been superseded by a much improved fan controller - ["Raspberry Pi PWM Fan Control in C and Python"](https://github.com/folkhack/raspberry-pi-pwm-fan-2)**

This library uses a stepwise function to control the fan speed which results in fans cycling on/off more than they need to. It's *highly* recommended you uninstall this controller script and upgrade.

## Uninstall Instructions:

```bash
# From the project's root with the makefile
# - Removes systemd service
# - Removes binary
# - Stops service
sudo make uninstall
````

# Historical readme.md:

Lightweight low-complexity fan controller that uses CPU temp that resides at `/usr/sbin/pwm_fan_control`.

Also comes with easy to use systemd service.

### Wiring:

**This configuration is for a 5V PWM fan!**

Pin numbers are basic Raspberry Pi "pin 1 starts at J8" numbers (not GPIO/etc. numbers).

* **PWM +5V** - Pin 4
* **PWM Ground** - Pin 6
* **PWM Speed Set** - Pin 12
* **PWM Speed Read** - (not required/supported) Pin 18; bridged to pin 17 (3.3V) with a 1k Ohm resistor

Wiring Notes:

* For a better visual follow wiring diagram listed here: https://blog.driftking.tw/en/2019/11/Using-Raspberry-Pi-to-Control-a-PWM-Fan-and-Monitor-its-Speed/#Wiring
* The PWM speed read is optional and can be wired if you want to read the actual fan speed as seen in the previous link

### Building/Installing:

**Requirements:**
* `wiringPi.h` obtainable from https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi (`build` script is in root of WiringPi project)

```bash
# Compile
make compile

# Compile with debugging enabled
make compile-debug

# Running (requires sudo to control GPIO)
sudo ./pwm_fan_control

# Installing (will make persistent service that starts at boot)
sudo make install
sudo make uninstall
```

---

### Use:

```bash
# Run with default PWM GPIO #12
pwm_fan_control

# Display help:
pwm_fan_control --help

# Raspberry Pi CPU PWM Fan Controller 
#
# Usage: pwm_fan_control [OPTION]... 
#
# Watches CPU temp and sets PWM fan speed accordingly with WiringPi library.
#
# --gpio BCM_GPIO_PIN_NUMBER       (default 18) BCM GPIO pin # for setting PWM fan speed 
#                                               12, 13, 18, 19 pins supported (hardware PWM) 
#
# Exit status: 1 if error 

##############

# Set a different PWM speed set GPIO pin
pwm_fan_control --gpio 13
```

**systemd Service GPIO Override** - If you're using this with a GPIO different than 18 you will want to update the
systemd service to add the `--gpio` argument as-seen below:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/
# Replace "ExecStart=/usr/sbin/pwm_fan_control"
#    with "ExecStart=/usr/sbin/pwm_fan_control --gpio 13"
```

### pigpio Instead of WiringPi

I did try to port this over to the better-supported pigpio library as-seen on the [pigpio_refactor branch](/folkhack/raspberry-pi-pwm-fan/tree/pigpio_refactor).

Unfortunately it resulted in consistent 5-10% CPU use on a Raspberry Pi 4 which was unacceptable for a simple use. The
above branch is working but should be considered unsupported for the time being.
